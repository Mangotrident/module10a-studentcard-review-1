# Module 10A â€“ StudentCard Code Review

## Description
This is a React code review assignment. I reviewed the StudentCard component and added comments to
explain the logic behind props, state, and interactivity.

## What I Learned
- How to use and identify props and state
- How toggle functionality works with useState
- How to better document and explain React components

## Screenshot
(Add a screenshot of the running component with your comments visible in the code editor)
